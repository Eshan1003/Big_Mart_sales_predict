# Big_Mart_sales_predict
Performed data analysis and preprocessing on the Big Mart sales dataset, then built a Random Forest Regressor model to accurately predict product sales, helping improve inventory and sales strategies.

Big Mart Sales Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for Big Mart outlets using historical sales data. By analyzing past sales patterns and product attributes, the model helps in forecasting future sales, which can assist in better inventory management and strategic decision-making.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains sales records of various products across multiple Big Mart stores. Key attributes include:

Item Identifier: Unique ID for each product

Outlet Identifier: Unique ID for each store/outlet

Item Weight: Weight of the product

Item Visibility: Percentage of total display area allocated to the product in a store

Item Type: Category of the product

Item MRP: Maximum Retail Price of the product

Outlet Establishment Year: Year in which the store was established

Outlet Size: Size category of the store (Small, Medium, Large)

Outlet Location Type: Location category (Urban, Semiurban, Rural)

Outlet Type: Type of outlet (Supermarket, Grocery Store, etc.)

Item Outlet Sales: Sales amount (target variable)

Objectives
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends and relationships between features.

To preprocess and clean data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as required.

To build a regression model using Random Forest Regressor to predict sales.

To evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics.

Methodology
1. Data Analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, outliers, and correlations.

Visualized distributions of numerical variables and relationships between sales and other features.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing data by imputing or removing null values.

Converted categorical variables into numeric form using label encoding and one-hot encoding.

Feature engineering to create or modify variables for better predictive power.

3. Model Building
Selected Random Forest Regressor as the prediction algorithm due to its robustness and ability to handle nonlinear relationships.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained the model on the training data.

Tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

4. Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).

Analyzed the importance of features to understand key drivers of sales.

Results
The Random Forest model achieved strong predictive accuracy, effectively capturing sales trends.

Feature importance analysis revealed that variables like Item MRP, Outlet Location, and Item Type significantly influenced sales predictions.
